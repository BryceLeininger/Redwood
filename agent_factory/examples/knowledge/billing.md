# Billing Playbook

Billing disputes should start with invoice verification. Confirm invoice number, period, and payment method before any adjustment.

Duplicate charge reports require transaction matching. If two payments share the same invoice and amount, escalate to billing operations for reversal.

Refund decisions should follow policy windows and contract terms. When approved, communicate expected settlement timing and reference ID.
