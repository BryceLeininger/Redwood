# Email Response Standards

For high-priority replies, open with acknowledgement, provide decision or answer, and close with the exact owner and due date.

For document requests, confirm which attachment version is being sent and whether signatures are required.

For meeting coordination, include agenda and attendees in the invite body so recipients understand purpose before accepting.

For billing communication, avoid making commitments without confirming invoice references and approval limits.
