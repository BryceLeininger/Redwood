# Customer Support Handbook

Technical incidents should include reproducible steps, product version, and severity. High-severity outages should be routed immediately to incident response.

Account management tasks include profile updates, access changes, and subscription changes. Verify account ownership before processing sensitive updates.

Sales conversations should capture organization size, required features, and contract timeline so account executives can provide accurate pricing.
