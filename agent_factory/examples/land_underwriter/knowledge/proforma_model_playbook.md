# Land Acquisition Proforma Playbook

Underwriting should begin with gross revenue assumptions tied to realistic absorption pace and current takeout pricing. Price assumptions should be stress tested using downside cases.

Direct development costs must include site work, utilities, roads, grading, impact fees, and contingency. Early-stage budgets should carry higher contingency percentages when engineering is incomplete.

Soft costs include entitlement, legal, architecture, and financing fees. These often rise when municipal approval paths are uncertain.

Residual land value equals stabilized project value minus total development costs, financing costs, developer overhead, and required profit margin.

Deal structure should enforce target return thresholds. Common screening metrics include minimum project IRR, minimum equity multiple, and maximum loan to cost.

If major risks are unresolved, apply pricing haircuts or require additional due diligence before issuing a letter of intent.
