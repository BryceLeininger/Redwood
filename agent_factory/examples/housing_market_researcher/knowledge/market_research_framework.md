# Housing Market Research Framework

Track supply, demand, affordability, and credit conditions together. Single-metric conclusions are often misleading.

Core supply indicators include active listings, months of supply, permit volume, and completion pipeline.

Core demand indicators include pending sales, mortgage applications, showing traffic, and migration flows.

Affordability should combine payment to income ratios, wage growth, insurance and tax burdens, and financing costs.

Segment analysis matters: entry-level, move-up, luxury, multifamily for-rent, and build-to-rent can move in different directions at the same time.

Use scenario-based conclusions, not point forecasts. Report base case, upside, and downside paths with triggers for each.
