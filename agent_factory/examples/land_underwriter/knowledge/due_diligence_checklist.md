# Land Due Diligence Checklist

Verify title, easements, and encumbrances before final pricing.

Confirm zoning status, allowable density, and timeline to entitlement.

Review topography, geotechnical conditions, wetlands, and floodplain impacts.

Map utility capacity and offsite improvement requirements.

Estimate schedule risk from permitting, environmental review, and public hearings.

Run base, downside, and severe downside scenarios before final investment committee approval.
