# Outlook Email Operations Guide

Inbox triage should start by identifying urgency, sender trust, and required action. Messages from executives, legal counsel, lenders, and active customers should be prioritized.

Use categories consistently: finance, legal, operations, sales, and personal admin. Category tagging allows fast retrieval and cleaner handoffs.

When drafting replies, summarize the request in one sentence, answer directly, and include explicit next steps with dates.

Calendar requests should be accepted only after validating conflicts and travel buffers. If conflicts exist, propose two alternative time options.

Potential phishing indicators include urgent credential requests, mismatched domains, and unusual attachment types. These should be flagged for review, not replied to.
